# Self-Compassion Conflict Worksheet

An interactive inventory tool for building self-awareness after difficult interactions.

## What is this?

This is a guided note-taking tool designed to help you reflect on what was happening for you during conflicts or challenging communications with others. It's an inventory—a way to track the many factors (physical, emotional, social, historical) that can pull us away from our best communication.

## What this tool IS

- ✅ A tool for building self-compassion and grace for yourself and others

## Why use this?

### The Complexity Factor
This worksheet includes 60+ different factors that can affect our ability to communicate with compassion and clarity. That's the point. When we see how many things can influence a single interaction—from blood sugar to past trauma to cultural expectations—it becomes harder to demonize ourselves or others for communication struggles.

### Building Awareness
With regular use after conflicts, you may start to notice:
- **Patterns** in what triggers you or affects your regulation
- **Blind spots** you didn't know you had
- **Strengths** you can lean on in future interactions
- **Needs** that often go unmet for you

### The Goal
Over time, this tool can help you:
- Develop better self-awareness of your internal experience
- Feel more confident advocating for your needs
- Extend grace to yourself when things don't go well
- Recognize that most conflicts involve multiple contributing factors—many beyond anyone's control
- Have better interactions, more often

## How to use it

1. **After a difficult interaction**, open the worksheet
2. **Describe what happened** in the context box
3. **Check boxes** for anything that was true for you during the interaction
4. **Add notes** in any category sections where you have additional thoughts
5. **Answer the reflection questions** at the bottom
6. **Save your worksheet** using one of the four save options (phone note, sticky note, TXT file, or PDF)
7. **Review your patterns** in the stats dashboard at the bottom

The magic happens with **regular use**. One worksheet won't reveal much, but patterns emerge over time.

## A Note on Grace

This tool exists because communication is hard. Really hard. We're navigating our own nervous systems, histories, needs, and cognitive patterns while simultaneously trying to understand another person doing the same thing. 

When you see all these factors laid out, the goal is not to excuse harmful behavior—yours or anyone else's. The goal is to develop **realistic expectations** about human communication and **compassion** for the complexity we're all managing.

**Here's the paradox:** The very elements of our humanity that lead to conflict—our needs, our histories, our vulnerabilities, our nervous systems—are the same elements that make connection possible. 

We hope you reach a point where you don't shame yourself or anyone else for these human factors. Where you can see that needing food, carrying trauma, feeling uncertain, or wanting to belong aren't flaws to fix but parts of being human to understand. These are the elements that both challenge us and connect us.

The goal isn't perfection. It's awareness. It's compassion. It's recognizing our shared humanity in all its messy, beautiful complexity.
